# miniMover

Code to control XYZ 3D printers that use the version 3 serial protocol.  
These include the Nano, Mini W, miniMaker and Jr. line of printers.

This is inspired by the threedub programs listed below but it is based 
on a fresh reverse engineering of the serial protocol.

This uses a modified version of the tiny-AES project by kkoke.
